I'm a professor at the University of Melbourne who studies and models human inference, learning, dynamic information systems, culture, and (mis/dis)info. Also a nerd and opinionated loudmouth living in Australia, originally from America, citizen of both. Parent of two. General weirdo. Ted Lasso is my hero. he/him üè≥Ô∏è‚Äç‚ößÔ∏è

I can be found [on Mastodon](<a rel="me" href="https://aus.social/@AndyPerfors">Mastodon</a>) chatting away. My [personal webpage](https://perfors.net/) is chaotically up-to-date (meaning: only sometimes, but one can never really predict this).
